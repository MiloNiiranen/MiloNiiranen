# Hi, my name is Milo! 👋

## About Me

- 🎓 I am a programming student at Gradia Viitaniemi.
- 📅 As of January 18, 2024, I have been studying programming for one and a half years.

## Experience

- 💼 **Work & Learning Experience:** I completed my practical training at Mosaiikki ry, where I worked on a project to create a game designed to help newcomers to Finland learn the Finnish language and familiarize themselves with Finnish culture. I chose to focus on Finnish traditional foods for the game. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I developed a web-based game that introduces players to various Finnish dishes and their cultural significance. I have  also practical experience working and learning at K-market in Mäyrämäki. I have also been working for my father, who is a private entrepreneur installing windows and doors. In K-Market, I stocked shelves, checked expiration dates, and organized packages ordered by customers for them to pick up later. At my father's workplace, I carried many heavy doors and windows, and I also had the opportunity to do some disassembling. I learned a lot about the tools used in my father's workplace during that time.

  
## Hobbies
- 🎮 In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, mostly first-person shooters (FPS). 
- 🏋️‍♂️🏸 I also engage in sports by going to the gym three times a week and occasionally playing badminton. 
- 🚶‍♂️ Additionally, I like to spend time outdoors, going for walks to enjoy the fresh air.
